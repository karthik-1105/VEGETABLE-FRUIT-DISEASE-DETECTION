# VEGETABLE-FRUIT-DISEASE-DETECTION
DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING USING MATLAB


Identification of the fruits/vegetable diseases is the key providing the losses in the yield and quantity of the agricultural
product. The studies of the fruits/vegetable diseases mean the studies of visually observable patterns seen on the plant.
Health monitoring and diseases detection on plant is very critical for sustainable agricultural. It is very difficult
to monitor the fruits/vegetable diseases manually. It requires tremendous amount of work, expertize in the fruits/vegetable diseases,
and also require the excessive processing time. In this project we discussed the methods used for detection of
fruits/vegetable diseases using their fruits/vegetable images.
